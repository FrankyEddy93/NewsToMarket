Synopsis:

Data Description:

Objective:

Approach: 
The set of 25 news for each day needs to be transformed to a format suitable for performing textual analysis 
and applying predictive model. 
We will be using both "BOW" and "n-gram" technique to model the data and perform a comparative performance 
analysis. 
1: Prepare the corpus 
Apply tokenization to separate the English tokens 
Stopwords removal and lemmatization 
Dictionary creation( bow , n-gram ) 
Tf-idf weighting 2: Apply Logistic, GNB models on the corpus and up with an accuracy value 
3: Perform topic modelling 
Apply LDA( Latent Dirichlet Allocation ) to come up with a representative topic for each doc 
Apply elbow analysis on k-means clustering to come up with an optimal number of topics

4: Apply sentiment analysis to extract the positive or negative sentiment of the combined docs per day 
and use this along with lda topics above to see if there are any improvements
